title: "Amethyst - an Agda library for NN verification"
type: "Webtool/Application"
year: "2020"
description: "Amethyst is an Agda library for neural network verification. Using Agda's expressive dependent type system, Amethyst is capable of specifying the desired properties of the neural network as a type. If your neural network doesn't have the right input/output behaviour, it won't even type-check! Amethyst is superseded by Vehicle in many ways."
impacts: "Led to creation of the tool Vehicle. Produced by Wen Kokke"
