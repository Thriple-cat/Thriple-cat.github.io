title: "Schmitty - an Agda library for SMT integration"
description: 'Schmitty is an Agda library which gives you bindings to SMT solvers, offering you is a well-typed embedding of some of the SMT-LIB language in Agda. That means as well as shouting “solve” at your problems, you can also write SMT queries yourself! Right now, Schmitty supports three theories—<a href="https://wenkokke.github.io/schmitty/SMT.Theories.Core.html">Core</a>, <a href="https://wenkokke.github.io/schmitty/SMT.Theories.Ints.html">Ints</a>, and <a href="https://wenkokke.github.io/schmitty/SMT.Theories.Reals.html">Reals</a>—and two backends—<a href="https://wenkokke.github.io/schmitty/SMT.Backend.Z3.html">Z3</a>, and<a href="https://wen.works/schmitty/SMT.Backend.CVC4.html">CVC4</a>. If you’re missing your favourite theory or solver, your contribution is more than welcome!'
