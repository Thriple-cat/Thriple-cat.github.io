title: "Amethyst - an Agda library for NN verification"
description: "Currently a work in progress, Amethyst is an Agda library for neural network verification. Using Agda's expressive dependent type system, Amethyst is capable of specifying the desired properties of the neural network as a type. If your neural network doesn't have the right input/output behaviour, it won't even type-check!"
