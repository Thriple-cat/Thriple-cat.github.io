title: "Neural Network Library in IMANDRA"
type: "Webtool/Application"
year: "2022"
description: "Neural networks are increasingly relied upon as components of complex safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. There is high demand for tools and methods that embed neural network verification in a larger verification cycle. However, neural network verification is problematic due to a wide range of verification properties of interest, each so far being amenable to verification only in specialised solvers. In this paper we show how Imandra, a functional programming language and a theorem prover originally designed for verification, validation and simulation of FinTech systems can offer a holistic infrastructure for neural network verification. To showcase Imandraâ€™s potential  as a single code base, we developed a novel library that formalises convolutional neural networks in Imandra, and covers different important facets of neural network verification."
impacts: "The software is used as part of industrial collaboration, with Industry Imanra (www.imandra.ai)"
